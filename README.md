❓ **Why not just manage contents using markdown files in a repository?**

While storing and editing Markdown files in a GitHub repository is typical for building blog websites, using GitHub Issues brings these benefits:
- more user-friendly interface with built-in labelling and search 🔍
- accessible from mobile app and website, good for capturing thoughts 📱
- streamlined workflow by leveraging [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/quickstart-for-projects) and Issue status (open/closed)
- free GitHub CDN for displaying images and videos
